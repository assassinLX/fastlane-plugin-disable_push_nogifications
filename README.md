# disable_push_notifications plugin

## About disable_push_notifications

When we build a enterprise release of our app. We use a `Wildcard App ID`, so we need disable the push notifications. This plugig can do that.

## Usage

```ruby
lane :test do
    # just apply to the first *.xcodrproj file and the first target in this proj
    disable_push_notifications
end
```

specific project or target
```ruby
disable_push_notifications(xcodeproj: your.xcodeproj, target: enterprise)
```

# Caution  

 This plug just remove the entitlements config, becareful of this.  

 You can also add a function to modify entitlements file. I'm very glad to see a PR.

# Note

I will not publish this plugin to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/).  
because this is a very rare requirement.
